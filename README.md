Welcome to the Magnetic Core Loss Modeling Web-Based GUI project! This project provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for modeling magnetic core losses in power electronics. The underlying model is based on the IEEE PELS-Google-Enphase-Princeton [MagNet Challenge 2023](https://github.com/minjiechen/magnetchallenge/tree/main) competition models. The website is currently deployed at "TBD"------ and maintained by The University of Sydney. 

## Features

- Customizable Parameters: Users can adjust various parameters (excitation waveform, operating frequency and temperature) to simulate different scenarios and analyze the impact of a periodic signal on core losses.
- Web-Based: Accessible through web browsers, eliminating the need for installation and providing convenience for users.
- Diverse Materials: Support up to 15 ferrites - 77, 78, 79, N27, N30, N49, N87, 3E6, 3F4, T37, 3C90, 3C92, 3C92, 3C94, ML95S

## Usage 
- Access the GUI: Visit [MagNet Engine] in your web browser.
- Select Model: Choose the model and targed material in the sidebar. 
- Input Parameters: Enter the required excitation and operating parameters into the designated fields. 
- View Results: Once the simulation is complete, visualizations and relevant data will be displayed on the interface.
- Analysis and Export: Analyze the results and export data if necessary for further processing.

## Installation 
There is no installation required for this web-based GUI. Simply access it through your web browser using the provided link.
